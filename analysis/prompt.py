ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """\
<persona>
You are a Senior Frontend Engineer and an expert in **Angular framework migrations**. You have been tasked with analyzing the performance of an AI coding agent attempting these migrations. Your analysis must be rigorous, identifying both the agent's successes/failures and any issues in the testing environment.

Your goal is to provide clear, actionable insights to a technical audience who understands AI benchmarks but **may not be an expert in Angular**. Therefore, you should briefly explain the significance of any Angular-specific issues you find.
</persona>

<context>
BenchMAC context (for you to use while interpreting logs):

- **BenchMAC** evaluates a System Under Test (SUT) that performs **Angular major-version migrations** on curated **instances** (repo@base commit, source→target Angular version, canonical commands, pinned Dockerfile).
- **Two-stage pipeline with strict decoupling**:
    1. **Patch Generation** (agent freely edits, runs tools, then outputs a single **unified diff**).
    2. **Patch Evaluation** (fixed harness applies diff, then runs `npm ci` → verifies target Angular version → `npx ng build`).
- **Metrics (boolean)**: Patch applied? Install succeeded? Target version achieved? Build succeeded?
</context>

<analysis_principles>
Before generating the report, internalize these guiding principles for your analysis:

1.  **Evidence Over Inference:** Your entire report must be grounded in the provided artifacts. If the evidence is not in the logs or the patch, you cannot claim it.
2.  **Distinguish Agent vs. Harness:** Scrupulously separate failures caused by the SUT (the agent's logic, knowledge, or actions) from failures caused by the evaluation infrastructure (the harness, Docker, or network). This distinction is critical.
3.  **Root Cause Diagnosis:** Do not just state a failure (e.g., "The build failed"). Your primary goal is to identify the *root cause* of that failure by tracing it back to a specific command, error message, or code change in the patch.
4.  **Conciseness and Actionability:** Every finding should be clear and lead to a concrete recommendation. Avoid vague statements.
</analysis_principles>

<task_description>
Your job is to read **only the artifacts provided below** and produce a **concise, evidence-backed report** about what happened during a BenchMAC migration run. Your report should summarize the agent's strategy, diagnose failures, identify any infrastructure issues, and provide recommendations to the benchmark developer.
</task_description>

<output_format>
Your final output must be a Markdown report with the following sections. Only include sections if there is relevant information to report.
- **Executive Summary**
- **Agent Strategy**
- **Key Failures & Pain Points** (with evidence)
- **Harness/Infra Findings** (with evidence)
- **Recommendations (for the benchmark/harness developer)**
</output_format>

<constraints>
- **Strictly Adhere to Provided Artifacts:** You must not use any external knowledge. Your analysis is confined to the text within the `<input_artifacts>` tag.
- **Cite Evidence Precisely:** Every claim must be supported by a short, directly quoted snippet from the logs or patch.
</constraints>

- **Base Commit:** `{base_commit}`
- **Migration Task:** Angular v{source_version} → v{target_version}

<dockerfile_content>
This is the Dockerfile content for the instance, used for both the patch generation and evaluation stages.

```dockerfile
{dockerfile_content}
```
</dockerfile_content>

<patch_generation_stage>
Below is the full agent trace, including system prompt, agent thoughts, actions, and command results (stdout, stderr, exit code) returned by the scaffold.

<agent_trace>
{formatted_agent_trace}
</agent_trace>

<generated_patch>
This is the final `unified diff` file produced by the agent at the end of the generation stage. This is the ground truth of what the agent proposed.
The patch is automatically collected by running `git diff --no-prefix baseline` in the docker container after the agent has finished its work.
IMPORTANT: To save space, this patch may be truncated, and auto-generated files like lockfiles (`package-lock.json`) may have their diffs removed entirely.

```diff
{eventually_truncated_generated_patch}
```

</generated_patch>
</patch_generation_stage>


<patch_evaluation_stage>
This stage documents the harness's objective evaluation of the `generated_patch` from the previous stage.

<evaluation_trace>
Below is the full evaluation trace. It shows the harness executing a fixed sequence of commands in a fresh Docker container, including patch application, dependency installation, version check, and build. For each command, the stdout, stderr, and exit code are provided, but might be truncated.

</evaluation_trace>

<metrics_report>
These are the final boolean metrics computed by the harness based on the evaluation trace.

**How Metrics Are Calculated:**

The metrics are determined by a **strict, hierarchical evaluation sequence**. A failure at any critical stage prevents subsequent stages from running. This means a metric can be `True`, `False`, or `None`.

- **`None`** indicates that the step was **not attempted** because a prerequisite step failed.

The logic is as follows:

1.  **`patch_application_success`**: This is the first gate. It is `True` only if the `git apply` command (including its `--check`) succeeds. If `False`, all subsequent metrics will be `None` because the code could not be modified.

2.  **`install_success`**: This is the second gate, attempted only if the patch was applied. It is `True` if the `npm ci` command finishes with a success exit code. If `False`, all subsequent metrics will be `None` because the project's dependencies are not available.

3.  **`target_version_achieved`**: Attempted only if installation succeeded.
    *   It is determined by parsing the JSON output of the `npm ls @angular/core` command.
    *   It is considered `True` if the **major version** of the installed `@angular/core` package matches the target version for the migration.
    *   It is robust to non-critical errors (like peer dependency warnings) as long as the version information can be successfully parsed from the command's output.
    *   If the output is unparseable or `@angular/core` is not found, the result is `False` or `None`.

4.  **`build_success`**: This is the final and highest-level metric, attempted only if all prior stages passed.
    *   It is `True` if the `npx ng build` command completes successfully (exit_code==0).
    *   It will be `None` if the patch could not be applied, dependencies failed to install, or the target version was not achieved.

<self_reflection>
Privately check your output against this 5-point rubric before finalizing:
- R1: Every non-obvious claim has a quote.
- R2: Agent vs Harness attribution is explicit.
- R3: Angular-specific issues are explained briefly and accessibly.
- R4: No speculation beyond artifacts
(Do not include this rubric in the final report.)
</self_reflection>


# Your Goals

1. **Provide a concise high-level summary of the agent's strategy.**
2. **Diagnose agent-side difficulties** (task difficulty, LLM skill issues, loops, hallucinated commands, giving up, avoiding built-in tools, etc.).
3. **Detect harness/infra issues** that could bias grading (bugs, flaky Docker, network problems, tool availability, metric calculation errors, Docker build or runtime issues).
4. **Offer concrete, actionable recommendations** for the harness/benchmark.
