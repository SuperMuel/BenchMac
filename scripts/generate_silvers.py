"""
Generates Known-Good Patches and a Packaged Submissions File for Harness Testing.

## The Problem

To test the BenchMAC evaluation harness, we need a set of "correct" patches
that are known to successfully migrate a benchmark instance. Without these, we
can't verify that our harness metrics (like BuildSuccess or TestPassRate) are
working correctly.

## The Solution

This script provides a way to generate these known-good patches, which we call
"Silver Patches". It leverages manually migrated projects where each major
version upgrade is a separate commit.

For a given benchmark instance (e.g., "migrate from v14 to v15"), this script:
1.  Identifies the `base_commit` for the starting version (v14).
2.  Looks up the corresponding `solution_commit` for the target version (v15)
    from a hardcoded map.
3.  Clones the repository and computes the `git diff` between these two commits.
4.  Saves this diff as a `.patch` file in `data/silver_patches/`.
5.  Collects all generated patches and packages them into a single
    `data/silver_submissions.jsonl` file for easy use with the main CLI.

The resulting files serve as perfect test inputs for the harness,
simulating the output of a successful AI agent and allowing for robust,
end-to-end testing of the evaluation pipeline.
